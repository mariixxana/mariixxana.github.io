### CPSC 120

* Lab #1

    Lab 1, was another favorite for me. This is because this was the first lab I ever did in this class and gave me a view of what we would be doing this semester. I got to learn and find my way through GitHub and how to use VS code because I had no prior experience with coding. Since it was simple, I liked being able to focus on how to use the programs. 

* Lab #2

    Lab 2, part 2 was also one of my favorites because it felt a little more challenging but still manageable. I was able to work with my partner in figuring out how to code. I was still learning how to start coding but getting to use strings this time and find out their difference from integers.

* Lab #4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I have always been interested in baking and part of that is being able to convert units when measuring all the ingredients. So this lab was fun because it was cool to see how we can program code to convert units for you. I can even use this in the future if I need to convert measurements while I am baking because sometimes I do forget the conversions. With this lab, I learned how I could code conversions.
